# Matrix Multiplication Using Flask Framework

## Aim

To create a matrix multiplication web application using the **Flask framework** in Python.

## Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication, also known as the matrix product, involves multiplying two matrices to produce a single matrix. If \( A \) and \( B \) are two matrices, their product is denoted by \( X = AB \).

## Flask Framework

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is considered a microframework because it does not include tools or libraries for database abstraction, form validation, or other components, relying instead on third-party libraries.

## Algorithm

1. **Setup Flask Application**:
   - Delete any existing `flask_app.py` file in the project directory.
   - Rename your main Python file to `flask_app.py` to match the expected filename for Flask applications.
   - Upload `flask_app.py` to the server.
   - If you have additional HTML, CSS, or other files, create `templates` and `static` directories and upload these files.
   - Go to the Web menu page and click on the Reload button to apply changes.

2. **Python Code (`flask_app.py`)**:
   ```python
   Your Code is Here
   ```

3. **HTML Files**:

   - **`mainfile.html`**:
     ```html
     Your Code is Here
     ```

   - **`home.html`**:
     ```html
     Your Code is Here
     ```
